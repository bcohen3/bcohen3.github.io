Hello! I am an aspiring doctoral student who completed my M.S. in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) in December 2023. My research interests are interdisciplinary and focus on analyzing the impact of new technologies through a regulatory lens, with a particular (though not exclusive) focus on AI.

I taught [AP Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course) at [Towson High School](https://towsonhs.bcps.org) in [Baltimore County, Maryland](https://www.bcps.org), for six years (out of eight total at THS). I now work full-time as an AP Computer Science assessment specialist at [Educational Testing Service](https://www.ets.org) and teach as an adjunct at [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/mathematics/). I also taught for the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](https://cty.jhu.edu) from 2017 to 2021 after serving as a TA during the 2015 and 2016 summers.

I received my BA in [Economics](https://www.wesleyan.edu/econ/) from [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) in 2010 and my [Master of Arts in Teaching](https://www.towson.edu/coe/departments/teaching/) (Secondary Mathematics concentration) from Towson in 2014. During my time at Wesleyan, I twice received the [Plukas Teaching Apprentice Award](https://www.wesleyan.edu/econ/honors/prizes.html), given annually to outstanding undergraduate TAs in the economics department. I also worked in the sports information office and received the [ECAC-SIDA Bill Esposito Award](https://east-comm.com/sports/2013/6/20/gen_0620133744.aspx) as a senior, becoming just the third winner from a Division III school at the time.
