This assignment focuses on improving the website of Toronto Cupcake, a small business that, as the name suggests, is a cupcakery located in Toronto. The case study began on September 29, 2025, and ended on November 2, 2025.

The overall goal of this project was to redesign the Toronto Cupcake website to appropriately apply design principles and improve the user experience. These changes were intended to address seven design principles:
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility</li>
    <li>Constraints</li>
    <li>Feedback</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Signifiers/affordances</li>
    <li>Mapping</li>
  </ul>

<p>In the process of completing this redesign, I learned many lessons about proper design that I had not previously
  considered until I saw them; I will keep this in mind for future design projects. Overall, this project has made me a
  better designer and has helped me hone my “soft skills.” I look forward to applying the lessons learned and the techniques
  practiced on future projects.
</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>
  Visibility refers to the idea that it should be simple for the user to find what they are looking for, whether that is
  the next step in a process (e.g., after I have paid for my emissions test, the kiosk should clearly indicate how I'm
  supposed to open it up to plug the weird cable thing into my diagnostic port-not make me fiddle around until the kind soul
  behind me tells me I have to push the door in to get it to open out) or navigation to a different stage (e.g., if I’m
  looking for men’s shorts and I’m in the “men’s” section of Nautica’s website, the “shorts” link should be readily apparent).
</p>

<p>
  While the process of adding cupcakes to one’s cart on the Toronto Cupcake website is generally straightforward, the steps
  that come after are significantly less so. Indeed, ambiguity in the buttons and commands makes it difficult for the user
  to know what they must do next to proceed with the ordering process. The following screen shot shows the “shopping cart”
  of a user who has added one or more items to their cart; the most logical option to proceed with the ordering process is
  to click the “Place Order” button <b>(Design V-1)</b>—but this does not actually place the order. (While the presence of a button
  reading “Place Order”—rather than, say, “Checkout”—on the shopping cart page differs from the practices of most e-commerce
  sites, this will be addressed in a later section; the focus here is on the ambiguity surrounding the next steps in the
  process, not on consistency with other websites.) <i>How do I pay for the cupcakes? How do I tell them where to deliver
  the cupcakes? Did I miss something earlier? Am I doing this right?</i> These are all questions that the existing design of the
  site could reasonably lead a user to ask.

  Moreover, upon clicking “Place Order,” the user is taken to a page that asks them to enter the sender’s and recipient’s
addresses and contact information; the page also asks users to check a box confirming that they understand the payment
process—that they will receive a secure payment link after their order has been reviewed—and then click a button
reading “Confirm Order” <b>(Design V-2)</b>. The layout of this portion of the page also suggests that the user is
affirming that they have read and understand the text contained on the “Confirm Order” page, although this is clearly
not the intent.

  To make things clearer for the user, the proposed redesign would change both the shopping cart page and the “Place
  Order” page. On the shopping cart page, the text of the “Place Order” button has been changed to “Checkout”
  <b>(Design V-1A)</b>—a minor change that nonetheless makes it clearer to the user how to proceed to the next step in
  the process. On the following page, “I have read and understand” has changed to “I have read and understand the above,”
  with the “Confirm Order” button moved below and to the right of the check box and the text in the section changed to
  reflect that this is the last step in the process <b>(Design V-2A)</b>. (Note that this also involves eliminating one
  page, streamlining the process and ensuring a smoother experience for the user. In addition, as shown in
  <b>Design V-2A</b>, the total cost of the order is now displayed on this page, eliminating the need for the user to
  navigate back to their shopping cart to view this.)
